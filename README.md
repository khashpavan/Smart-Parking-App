SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATED SMART PARKING
REPORT

TO DO              : -    Design a system for automated car parking system.
ALGORITHM   : -   1.The idea of this working model  was taken from  FCFS , pipelining and even the shortest path .


DISCUSSIONS    :-     The working part of smart parking system is developed in an application such that it could be easier for customer  to access (book his parking lot ticket) and can have an well organised way of parking.In this we take the details (Name, Mobile no. , registration no. of the car , Model of the car[SUV / Hatchback/Sedan/Convertible] ), register the person’s vehicle details for identification  and asks the time slot for his parking of his vehicle , by analysing these details our application allots a suitable parking slot (using the algorithm) for the user and even the fare is finalised and can be paid by the user .
And here majorly the slot gets emptied by changing flag (1 to 0), here the slot empties;
If t=all the slots are full then user gets a notification while booking that “Sorry we’re out of space ”.
